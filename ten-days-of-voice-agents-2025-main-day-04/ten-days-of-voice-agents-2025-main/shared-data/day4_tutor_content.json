For example, 'x = 5' creates a variable named 'x' that holds the number 5. You can use variables to store numbers, text, lists, and more, making your code reusable and easier to read.",

There are two main types: 'for' loops, which iterate over a sequence (like a list), and 'while' loops, which keep running as long as a certain condition is true. Loops are essential for automating repetitive tasks.",
